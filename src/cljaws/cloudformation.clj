;; Many AWS API calls depend on others. For instance, if we wanted to
;; get a list of resources for a Cloudformation stack, we have to know
;; the stack name we want to get the list of resources for. If we
;; wanted to find all stacks that reference a specific resource, we
;; have to first get a list of all stacks, and then query each stack
;; for a list of referenced resources, to see if the given stack
;; references the resource. If we have 600 stacks, then this query
;; will require 600 independent queries to AWS.
;;
;; We need to avoid getting rate limited, and we need to keep track of
;; what stacks referenced the given resource.
;;
;; To do this, we use doseq, instead of map, and add items to a global
;; atom until all the stacks have been queried, sleeping for half a
;; second in between API calls, as to avoid getting rate limited.
